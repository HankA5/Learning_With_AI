# Learning_With_AI
Learning with AI repository for CSC 494.

## Software Domain
I hope to learn better using AI how to perform sensor data analysis. 
Why I need to learn this:
My lizard habitat uses sensors (temperature, humidity, and light). I need to understand how to process this data and decide when conditions are outside safe ranges.

## Hardware Domain
I will use AI to learn how to use sensors to gather accurate data to be processed.
Why I need to learn this:
The project requires sensors to collect real-time temperature and humidity data from the enclosure.
